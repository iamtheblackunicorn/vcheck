# VCHECK :ribbon: :rocket:

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/vcheck/actions/workflows/vue.yml/badge.svg)

***Check your passwords from anywhere. :ribbon: :rocket:***

## ABOUT :books:

A year ago, I wrote an algorithm to check the security of passwords, any passwords. I implemented it in Dart, the implementation of which can be found [here](https://iamtheblackunicorn/securitycheck). I recently decided to rewrite the implementation in ECMA Script, a.k.a. Javascript. I did that, but then decided to make a shiny little web application out of the Javascript implementation. This is that shiny web application. The ES implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/vulcheck). My one true love, having been Python, has shifted to Rust and the implementation of the same algorithm can be found [here](https://iamtheblackunicorn/flek). :heart:

- Node.js
- Git

Once you have these tools installed, execute these steps:

- 1.) Get the source code:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/vcheck
```

- 2.) Change directory into the source's root directory:

```bash
$ cd vcheck
```

- 3.) Install the project's dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

- 4.) Run Vue's development server:

```bash
$ npm run serve
```

- 5.) Optional: To compile this project, run this command:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

## USAGE :hammer:

To use ***VCHECK***, simply type in one of the passwords you use, press the button and wait. My algorithm will tell you if your password is secure or not.
The app will tell you how high you ranked according to ***VCHECK***'s algorithm and if the score is greater than eight, the algorithm deems your password to be secure. That's it. :heart_on_fire:
